## Deno SMTP mail client

### IMPORTANT SECURITY INFORMATION

PLEASE update to a version >= 0.8! 0.8 has a problem where malformed mails could
potentialy allow attackers to create a mail (with linebreaks) to send unwanted
SMTP commands. This could result in authentic phishing attacks! With no way for
the user to identify that this is a phishing mail! Or that this mail contains a
dangerous attachment!

Also make sure that Mails are sent one after the other as they can corrupt each
others data!

### Allowed Mail Formats

A single Mail `mail@example.de` with a name `NAME` can be encoded in the
following ways:

1. `"name@example.de"`
2. `"<name@example.de>"`
3. `"NAME <name@example.de>"`
4. `{mail: "name@example.de"}`
5. `{mail: "name@example.de", name: "NAME"}`

Where 1-3 is called a "MailString".

Multiple Mails can be an Array of the above OR a object that maps names to mails
for example:

`{"P1": "p1@example.de", "P2": "p2@example.de"}` we call this a MailObject.

For the fields

1. `from`, `replyTo` we only allow a "MailString".
2. `to`, `cc`, `bcc` we allow a MailObject a Array of single Mails or a single
   Mail.

### Sending multiple mails

Note that for race-condition reasons we can't send multiple mails at once.
Because of that if send is already called and still processing a mail
`client.send` will queue that sending.

### Example

```ts
import { SmtpClient, quotedPrintableEncode } from "https://deno.land/x/denomailer/mod.ts";

const client = new SmtpClient();

await client.connect({
  hostname: "smtp.163.com",
  port: 25,
  username: "username",
  password: "password",
});

await client.send({
  from: "mailaddress@163.com",
  to: "Me <to-address@xx.com>",
  cc: [
    "name@example.de",
    "<name@example.de>",
    "NAME <name@example.de>",
    {mail: "name@example.de"},
    {mail: "name@example.de", name: "NAME"}
  ],
  bcc: {
    "Me": "to-address@xx.com"
  },
  subject: "Mail Title",
  content: "Mail Content",
  html: "<a href='https://github.com'>Github</a>",
  date: "12 Mar 2022 10:38:05 GMT",
  priority: "high",
  replyTo: 'mailaddress@163.com',
  attachments: [
    { encoding: "text"; content: 'Hi', contentType: 'text/plain', filename: 'text.txt' },
    { encoding: "base64"; content: '45dasjZ==', contentType: 'image/png', filename: 'img.png' },
    {
      content: new Uint8Array([0,244,123]),
      encoding: "binary",
      contentType: 'image/jpeg', 
      filename: 'bin.png'
    }
  ],
  mimeContent: [
    {
      mimeType: 'application/markdown',
      content: quotedPrintableEncode('# Title\n\nHello World!'),
      transferEncoding: 'quoted-printable'
    }
  ]
  
});

await client.close();
```

#### TLS connection

```ts
await client.connectTLS({
  hostname: "smtp.163.com",
  port: 465,
  username: "username",
  password: "password",
});
```

#### Use in Gmail

```ts
await client.connectTLS({
  hostname: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 465,
  username: "your username",
  password: "your password",
});

await client.send({
  from: "someone@163.com", // Your Email address
  to: "someone@xx.com", // Email address of the destination
  subject: "Mail Title",
  content: "Mail Contentï¼Œmaybe HTML",
});

await client.close();
```

### Configuring your client

You can pass options to your client through the `SmtpClient` constructor.

```ts
import { SmtpClient } from "https://deno.land/x/denomailer/mod.ts";

//Defaults
const client = new SmtpClient({
  console_debug: true, // enable debugging this is good while developing should be false in production as Authentication IS LOGGED TO CONSOLE!
  unsecure: true, // allow unsecure connection to send authentication IN PLAIN TEXT and also mail content!
});
```
